## Overview

This repo contains the workshop material for using R/tidyverse to
analyze & visualize diverse datasets, *e.g.,*
[transcriptomics](https://github.com/jananiravi/workshop-tidyverse/tree/master/transcriptomics),
[gapminder](https://github.com/jananiravi/workshop-tidyverse/tree/master/gapminder)
\| as HTML
([transcriptomics](https://jananiravi.github.io/workshop-tidyverse/transcriptomics/workshop-tidyverse)
&
[gapminder](https://jananiravi.github.io/workshop-tidyverse/gapminder/workshop-tidyverse-gapminder)).

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, you will be able to load your genomic
dataset, perform basic data tidying & wrangling, data visualization, and
save/export your results using `tidyverse`! Hopefully, you will also
have a newfound appreciation for reproducible research and R!

## Setup

### Before the Workshop Begins

1.  Install the following software if you don't yet have them. If you do
    have these installed, skip to #2:
    1.  **R** version `3.6+` (Current: `4.2.0`) \| [Download
        R](https://www.r-project.org/)
    2.  **RStudio** version `1.3+` (Current: `2022.02.2-485`) \|
        [Download
        RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) OR
        use [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud)
2.  Ensure that your version of **R** is `3.6+`. The latest version is
    `4.2.0`. To check your R version, type in your console: `version`
3.  Check your **RStudio** version. It should be `v1.3+` Open RStudio.
    In the top menu bar click: RStudio \> About RStudio \>
4.  Install **tidyverse**, **here**, **gapminder** (not needed for
    transcriptomics workshop), **gganimate**: <br>
    `install.packages(c("tidyverse", "here", "gapminder"))` <br>
    `devtools::install_github(â€˜thomasp85/gganimateâ€™)`
5.  Access useful [Cheatsheets
    here](https://github.com/jananiravi/cheatsheets).

and R Studio**

#### For Windows Users

[Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0PjTAylwoU) <br>
Install R by downloading and running [this `.exe` file from
CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm). Also,
please install the [RStudio
IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). Note
that if you have separate user and admin accounts, you should run the
installers as administrator (right-click on .exe file and select "Run as
administrator" instead of double-clicking). Otherwise problems may occur
later, for example when installing R packages.

#### For Mac Users

[Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-ly3kyxwEg) Install R
by downloading and running [this `.pkg` file from
CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/R-latest.pkg). Also, please
install the [RStudio
IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).

#### For Linux Users

You can download the binary files for your distribution from
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/index.html). Or you can use your
package manager (e.g. for Debian/Ubuntu run
`sudo apt-get install r-base` and for Fedora run `sudo dnf install R`).
Also, please install the [RStudio
IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).
